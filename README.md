# Seattle-Pet-Licenses-Analysis
Overview : 
This project aims to analyze Seattle pet licenses data to understand patterns and trends in pet ownership within the city. The project utilizes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to process the data, starting from data profiling using Alteryx, followed by data staging and transformation, and finally visualizing the insights using Power BI and Tableau.

Dataset : 
The dataset used for this project contains information about pet licenses issued in Seattle. It includes details such as pet species, breed, owner information, license issue date, and more. The dataset provides valuable insights into the pet population and ownership trends in the city.

Process : 
Data Profiling with Alteryx: The initial step involved thorough data profiling using Alteryx. This stage helped in understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying missing values, outliers, and gaining an overall understanding of the data quality.

Data Staging and Transformation: After data profiling, the next phase focused on data staging and transformation. This step involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and preparing the data for analysis and visualization.

Database Storage: The transformed data was then stored in a new database for efficient retrieval and analysis. This ensured that the data is organized and accessible for further processing and querying.

Visualization with Power BI & Tableau: The final step of the project involved visualizing the insights extracted from the data using Power BI & Tableau. Various visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards were created to showcase key trends and patterns in pet ownership within Seattle.
